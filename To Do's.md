# To Do's:
 - I need to look into |> operator to simplify the global namespace 
instead of using local namespaces.
- Save the results at the end
- I am currently being a bad programmer by not using dataframes,jl
- I should probably also use CSV fuck.
- This mioght bring my code under the goal

# Plan
 - function to multithread solvers in batches (yet to come)
 - I need to implement the repetition of each of the solvers
      - not going to hold on the actual C14 and only save the time
 - Lower priority is fixing Github 
 - Fix the local declarations
 - Linear color scaling for the accuracy and time  

# Goals
 - I think I should be able to do all this in _100_ lines of code
