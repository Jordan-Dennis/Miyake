# To Do's:
 - I need to look into |> operator to simplify the global namespace 
instead of using local namespaces.
 - I want to have a plot that places things into quadrants based on 
 the speed and the accuracy 
 - I first need to look into how to measure the accuracy of the result
 using an assymptotic behaviour of the RK45 solver as the time step is
 reduced 
 - I need to work on the comparison of accuracy using the median 
 - First I need to get the bin function working
 - I want to web scrape the list of ODEs from DifferentialEquations.jl
 - I want to export the data to a .csv for ease of manipulation.
 - I need to look into using CSV and Requests and Statisitics
 - Lower priority is fixing Github
