# To Do's:
 - I need to look into |> operator to simplify the global namespace 
instead of using local namespaces.
 - Save the results at the end
 - I am currently being a bad programmer by not using dataframes,jl
 - I should probably also use CSV fuck.
 - This mioght bring my code under the goal
 - I really need two files. 
 - You know what I am going to delete my orbital simulation and also the
 failed attempt at the lennard jones particle simulation.

## File One
 - Generates the dataset 

## File Two 
 - Analyses the data. 

# Plan
 - function to multithread solvers in batches (yet to come)
 - Lower priority is fixing Github 
 - Fix the local declarations
 - Linear color scaling for the accuracy and time  

# Goals
 - I want to have the profiling script in under _100_ lines 
 - I will have the analysis script in under _50_ lines
