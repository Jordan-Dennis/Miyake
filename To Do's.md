# To Do's:
 - I need to look into |> operator to simplify the global namespace 
instead of using local namespaces.
 - I want to have a plot that places things into quadrants based on 
 the speed and the accuracy 

# Plan
 - function to multithread solvers in batches (yet to come)
 - Let's get the basic plot going
 - I need to implement the repetition of each of the solvers
- Lower priority is fixing Github 
 - Fix the local declarations
  

# Goals
 - I think I should be able to do all this in _100_ lines of code
