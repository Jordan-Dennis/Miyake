# To Do's:
 - I need to look into |> operator for simplicity -- SERIOUSLY 
 - So I want to generalise now at the end.
    - This will require an equilbrium calculation with steady_state_production arg
 - Error catching is a priority 

# Plan
 - Lower priority is fixing Github 
 - Fix the local declarations -- Current priority 
 - Generalisation to any of the prebuilt models is important
    - Equilibriate function required

# Dumping thoughts
 - I want to refactor the code and have it more general
 - I also have to profile the gradients and the solvers separately
  which means running exactly twice as much as I would like 
 - Things are getting very long and I am not a big fan
 - static typing only once everything is working 

# Goals
 - I want to have the profiling script in under _200_ lines 
      - This is including the generalisations and the derivatives 
 - I will have the analysis script in under _50_ lines
