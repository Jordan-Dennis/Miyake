# To Do's:
 - I need to type hint my functions using the _::Type_ syntax
 - I need to look into |> operator to simplify the global namespace 
instead of using local namespaces.
 - I want to have a plot that places things into quadrants based on 
 the speed and the accuracy 
 - I first need to look into how to measure the accuracy of the result
 using an assymptotic behaviour of the RK45 solver as the time step is
 reduced 
 - How the hell does the Brehm equilibriation work?
 - All right. So I use Brehm equilibriation to work out the steady state 
 production and then I use it again to work out the matrix. WTF
 - In the production function I am using 1.88. How does this make sense 
 given the mess of an equilibriation that just occured.
