# To Do's:
 - I need to look into |> operator for simplicity
 - I really need two files. 
 - So I want to generalise now at the end.
    - This will require an equilbrium calculation with steady_state_production arg

## File One
 - Generates the dataset 

## File Two 
 - Analyses the data. 

# Plan
 - function to multithread solvers in batches (yet to come)
 - Lower priority is fixing Github 
 - Fix the local declarations
 - I need to calculate the gradients with respect to the parameters 
 and profile.   
    - This is done best using the package FowardDiff
 - Generalisation to any of the prebuilt models is important
    - Equilibriate function required


# Goals
 - I want to have the profiling script in under _100_ lines 
 - I will have the analysis script in under _50_ lines
