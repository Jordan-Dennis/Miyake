    "The function below will also have a `shape` parameter eventually. First however I want to get this running. Damn this really is well suited to a class structure since then I can set `self.set_annual_samples()` need to check if this has actually been implemented. The answer is __No__. I need to add the growth seasons to the `model_units` (which I might just rename `models`). This will lead to ?two? extra field `hemisphere_model` (bool) and `growth_seasons`. Alternatively this could result in a further nested dictionary like `hemispheres = {\"NH_growth\": array([]), \"SH_growth\": array([])}`"

I then run this model and subtract it away from the data allowing me to determine the signal to noise ratio of the entire data instead of a subset. Then I simulate a series of events and minimize the $\\chi^{2}$ to determine the best fitting rectangular event. In addition I will have some criterion for the $\\chi^{2}$ as to when an event is detected allowing me to identify the minimum parameters of the event. I will then plot a contour plot of the $\\chi^{2}$ in the 2 dimensional parameter space. This will be the final product."
