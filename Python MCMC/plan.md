# MCMC 
So I want to go looking for python implementations of `mcmc` outside of `emcee` and profile them on the different models. This should allow me to reduce the run time of my code considerably.

# ODE Solvers Python
So I want to try the `bosh` solver for each of the models and data sets. This should be easy.
